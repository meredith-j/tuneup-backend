🎧 What is tuneup?<br/>
Tuneup syncronizes Spotify & Apple music playlists so that you can share consistent playlists across platforms. Whether you are a creator sharing playlists with your followers (who may use a different streaming service than you) or planning a roadtrip with friends and want to collaborate on car tunes without needing to pay for extra streaming services, 💿tuneup will help automate the process!<br/>
